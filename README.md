### Introduction

This repository contains the codes and models described in the paper "[Geometry-Aware Distillation for Indoor Semantic Segmentation](https://jianbojiao.com/pdfs/cvpr_GAD.pdf)" . This work addresses the problem of semantic segmentation for indoor scenes, by incorporating geometry-aware knowledge implicitly.

### Usage

0. The project was implemented and tested with Python 2.7, [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) (version 0.3) and [TorchVision](https://pytorch.org/docs/0.2.0/) (version 0.2.0) on Linux with GPUs. Please setup the environment according to the [instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) first.
1. Download the model with the [script](models/download.sh) under folder "models".
2. Run the [main.py](main.py) to evaluate the performance on the NYUD-v2 dataset for semantic segmentation.
3. You may optionally store the network predictions (color-coded results) by uncommenting line 70 in [main.py](main.py). The results will be saved to a folder "outimgs".
